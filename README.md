# The_Password_manager
A free software to keep your passwords safely locked up. And in case you forget a password you can sign in and retrieve them.

For now i can provide just a beta (still working on it). And also if you want to add your passwords you actually need to dig the code up a bit (srry for that in case you´re a unexperienced user)
Here below i´m going to provide you with a tutorial how to use the python version:

Step 1:
First download python from the official site

Step 2:
When it´s installed right click on the file named the_password_manager and from the menu select edit with IDLE

Step 3: 
There you´re gonna get presented with further instructions on how to set your own username and password and how to import all of your passwords.

NOTICE: Now i´m able to provide just the python version.
